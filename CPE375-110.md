about space - condition on site - context.  - try to think in conditions
- is it too dark 
- is it too bright

when use sensors 
- consider about controller
	- choice can be vary: cheap computer, pc with good GPU, supercomputer
	- use it according to your tasks, save your cost but not too greedy.  
	- mini pc - raspberry pi, intel nuc, 
		- museum siam uses mac mini cuz it small, easy to hide and compact.

you are not go to the exhibition everyday 
- admin or volunteers usually don't have deep technical knowledge 
- so you should make UI easy to navigate, troubleshoot
