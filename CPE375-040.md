# 1. Introduction
on 2024-02-06, Students in our class have to visit Investory Stock Exchange of Thailand at afternoon (14:00-17:00 AM). before that, we have a short class about Exhibition-Museum Design Process  around 10:30 AM to 12:00 AM

# 2. Crystalized
There are two main topics that I want to highlight from this class

The first topic is about software design pattern. In basic software or code, we ususally don't think about how we should write our code, which parts responsible for this task, for that task, etc. But when we need to develop big software that require maintainance overtimes, develop software that require the cooperations from many modules, etc. you need to design the way to develop those software to not get too much hassle later on. 
There are many software design patterns to choose based on your circumstance or preference, but here are some quick intro

the fun fact is the teamlab also uses MVC and develop-in-layers concept to develop their works. 

MVC is the software design pattern that devided the system into 3 main parts: Model, view, controller. For the deeper details i suggest this article

It shows that softwate development patterns can be used to develop other fields (Exhibition design in this case) as well, so it is quite useful to learn. 

The second concept is types of software product based on generic vs customized. generic products are software for majority of people and customized products are software made specifically for specific use cases, specific customer. To identify your software type at the beginning of development phase is crucial thing to do, because this leads to two completely different pathway. to make software for majority of people, accessible, appeal and "can-be-navigated-or-used-by-everyone" became the bigger things to consider, while to make customized software, you need to consider to very specific usecases from very specific customer.

Others concepts are mainly about SDLC, Exhibition desigh, which have a lot of details that we must explore in our free time, I provided some contents about it in the "Encounter" section.

After we finish the class, we then grab some lunch and travel to the SETT, and enter the INVESTORY learning center.
# 3. Enconter
I make a little preparation before enter the class
- prepare what kinds of question to keep in mind when go to INVESTORY
	1. How it works
	2. Microcontroller used => for learning about suitable specification for each tasks
- Aj.Piyanit post her guideline on this topics
	- concept, main idea
	- if we can modify them, how it gonna be
	- explain visitor's movement in that area
Learn Inclass
- About **Software design pattern**
	- software design patterns are crucial for this kind of works, Teamlab also think in MVC and Layers
	- we didn't learn about software design pattern yet
	- Some interesting sources from sensei 
		- https://theiotacademy.medium.com/10-common-software-architectural-patterns-in-a-nutshell-1b1f6cf5036b
		- MVC model view control
- Aj. remind us about feedback loop and sending message to ppl 
Class review
- reminder about Interactivity; cyclic process
- types of software product
	- generic products; software for mass ppl
	- customized products; software made specifically for specific use cases, specific customer 
- Software process activities
	- software specification
		- define requirements based on customer’s needs 
	- Software development
	- Software validation
		- Is it work as customer intended 
	- Software evolution 
		- Polishing 
- Design and development process for museum and exhibition 
	- development process 
		- conceptual phase
		- development phase
			- Planning stage
			- Content development
		- functional phase
			- operation stage
				- present to public
			- terminating stage
				- terminating stage while focusing on cost savings 
		- assessment phase
			- evaluate, assessing, 
	- type of museum & exhibition
		- spectrum : object content vs information content
		- just arrange object vs adding more text, approaching educational exhibition
- Design brief 
	- from wiki: a document for a designed project, used by designer to consult with clients. 
	- from cambridge dict: a written description of what a new project or product should do, what is needed to produce it, how long it will take, etc.
- some useful concept
