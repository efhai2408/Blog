Class assignment 
- deadline: 5 may
- 1-2 ppl
- equipment: 
	- 1 laptop run unity with vuforia plugin
	- Webcam track AR image

Today we learned about XR, MR, VR, AR, Spatial: How it different, How we differentiate it, what exactly is …, technology used in …, trends in …
- big holistic view 
	- Reality–virtuality continuum 
		- it's like a spectrum between Real and Virtual, and what in between. 
		- this is useful concept to think about when you design how people interact with our product (interactive system design)
- Real Environment
	- Tangible user interface 

- Augmented Reality
- Augmented Virtually
	- Spartial AR
	- See-through AR
	- Semi-immersive AR 
- VR
	- Key characteristics for VR 
		- 3 key points 
	- Low latency head tracking: reason why VR is completed around 2016

- Augmented Reality 
	- Defining Characteristics Azuma97
	- 3 key points 
	- see both 
	- Meta quest is VR+ AR+MR 
- About MR 
	- MR(old definition): device that can transition between AR,VR 
	- MR(new definition ): AR+spatial mapping
- Spatial mapping& Spatial ankle: something AR is stays where it has been

- Types of VR
	- Cave&desktop vr
	- 

- Types of AR
	- Mobile AR
	- Spatial AR or sAR
		- aka projector mapping (now)
		- Room Alive-Spatial from microsoft
			- open source 
	- Situated AR
		- miku dance in prism
		- SpaceTop MIT media lab
		- 
	- Optical See though HMD
		- widely used in military 
	- Video ST hmd
		- Apple vision 
		- Meta quest 3
		- Visual artifact problem hen something too closed 
> In air interaction
> - Not precise 
> - Human hand not opt for write on air precisely

- interaction tasks in XR
	- Obj interaction
		- Selection 
			- U should also have to think about selecting virtual obj from far away
		- Manipulation
			- World in miniature WIM
				- voodoo doll
			- Direct …..
			- ….
		- There is also object interaction taxidermy 
	- Navigation: not crash something irl
		- quite hard field of research
	- Menu control

Brief about assignment

VR affordance
- hint on how it functioned and interact
- virtual obj didn't provide physical feedback

How should UI located.
- there is follow along ui

Travel in XR
- there are many technique
	- Teleport
		- disorientation problem: eh where am i 
	- Google earth flying through
		- Reality: flying with tunnel vision to reduce nausea 


- spatial sound design
	- spatialization 
		- Where the sound is come from
	- Localization
		- How ppl perceive sound



10 usability heuristic (nielson norman)
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and realworld
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards 
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist design
9. Help user for error
10. Help and documentarion

XR prototyping
