# Structure of this note
I'm now experimenting with new ways of taking notes; this is my writing format.
1. intro
2. Summary
	 summarize everything for short brief
3. Encounter
	 details, this session is mainly what I jot-down from this class, something that pique my interest and what it remind me.
4. References
my current writing process: I will write the Encounter session first, then highlight some keywords, important ideas then summarize them in the Summary session. the Summary session comes before the Encounter session because It seems more convenient in use-case scenario that I need to revisit and skim many notes.
# 1. Introduction
This is my first class in this course. In fact, this class is supposed to be the second but I misread the time table in previous week, bruh. 

Aj.Priyakorn (my senior project’s co-advisor and the one who invited me to intern at Bremen Uni) and   Aj.Piyanit (she teach Software engineer course at our Uni and also one of 3 ppl who visit me at Bremen Uni) are mentors of this course

unimportant remarks: I will write this blog in English by 2 main reasons
1. to improve my English writing skills. 
2. I can't touch typing in thai (yet). Now I'm experimenting with new keyboard layout:  [Manoonchai](https://manoonchai.com) the author said that this layout developed by Big Data and AI to improve typing efficiency compared with Thai Kedmanee layout by 40%. if you interest, please check his website.

# 3. Encounter
- Aj.Priyakorn talk about `BACC event` that ESIC lab and some ppl from fab lab were involved.
	-  [NOISE](https://www.facebook.com/ESICLAB/posts/pfbid02QqacPaMFX92cjQHSQ1F2imSpBAQ3Ap8xgK9nNtfZP83dsV2PuMHuebMgUuXTenYLl)
	- She invited us to that exhibition
- this class is taught in english because some international program students enroll this course.
- `We need to write weekly blog`.
- 1 student in this class present her assignment from previous week
	- she write her blog in notion
		- This `remind me` of my old time when I used this software to journaling around 2-3 years ago, and used it to colaborate, write log book with my teammate during internship.
		- This software is great tool for publish idea and write personal blog post because this software is packed with many features that let everyone customize their personal note and databased for free, in fully sync cloud.
		- By the way, I prefer obsidian markdown editor for personal notes, 2nd brain notes that I didn’t planned to publish, because of it’s customizable, and let us own all of my data in markdown format that I not gonna lost it if something bad happen with the company.
	- she write about particle photon iot microcontroller.
		- I like the art at the back of this board’s PCB
	- references from outsources are provided in this blog
		- One of it comes from ==FB page: IOT engineering education==
			- Aj.Priyakorn suggest that this is good page for CPE students.
	- one example reminds me of [youtube video](https://youtube.com/shorts/fflbel1uvxA?si=AX2C0X71Z6xPBthJ) that [some channel](https://www.youtube.com/@UwosLab) make christmas tree that glows when someone sends him messages.

- `Aj.Priyakorn's recommendation about blog post`
	- describe lecture
		- try not to be in ECHO chamber
	- put your idea

		- record learning, what u had learn 
			- its like u construct your portfolio
	- example+experiment+explore new things
	- extra knowledge with references
- Aj.Priyakorn talk about `why we must merge sci with arts`
	- one prime example for me is leonardo darvinci
		- Aj.Priyakorn expand my concept
			- back then when she still studying, she has been told to study about his works for 1 years 
- I interested in `Human-Centric Design Thinking Process`
- expand `interactive concept(1 of main idea of this course`
	- feedback 
	- action-reaction loops
	- interactivity
		- cyclic process 
- `course outcome- what to expected` 
	- integrate, installation our tech made with hardware and interactive software in museums
		- coding, write some program
		- create interactive software design in the form of
			- graphic
			- games
