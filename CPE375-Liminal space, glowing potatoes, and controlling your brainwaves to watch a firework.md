- Liminal space
	- What is liminal space
   - Place during 'Transition'
    - according to Jinjoon Lee, Living is also liminal space (state during Life and death)
	- backroom
		- horror 
		- fear of unknown
	- life and death is also liminal space
	- for me, This concept interesting because this concept seems to have deep connection with human instinct that related to life-and-death scenario, and this concept play a big role in modern internet meme and culture, make this word seems fascinating.
