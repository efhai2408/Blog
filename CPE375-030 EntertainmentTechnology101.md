# 1. Intro
2 days ago, I visit BACC and some of BKK design week 2024's places with my high school friend. I will provide details later in CPE375-021 note. 

at the beginning of the class, we have a short discussion about what each of us encounter at BACC and BKK design week 2024.
# 2. Crystalized
> [!NOTE]
> What I synthesize after encounter? 
> Brief summary + my perspective

 - What to do next
	 - Explore INVESTORY online
	 - Visit digital media or creative techs in BKK design week 2024
- Sometime we need to think like designer, especially when we need vision.
	- designer is like a middle man between artist and engineer 
	-  we must design and explore about who will use our tech or who will be beneficial first
		- many newbie engineers usually don't have this mindset
- What I learned from NOISE behind the scene
	- context: NOISE is the media art project from ESIC Lab that has been shown at BACC last week.
	- consider about analogue feedback in your interactive art work might be game changer, It make our art more tangible and impactful. 
	- Artist interpret info from engineer, reconstruct it to represent their message.
		- (in this case lol)
	- from CPE375-021 (note about me travel in BACC), I tried to measure sound intensity in DB unit with my phone, it swings between 86-90++
- if the interactive art let many ppl interact together: Good in many cases 
- behavioral analysis is important, you need to understand ppl who will use your product (it involved in UX and UI design)
	- Consider about User Persona
- Entertainment Technology
	- consist of 3 main components:
		- Technology
		- Business
		- Entertainment & Art & Creative
	- value chain
		- content acquisition >  operation > distribution > marketing n sale > delivery
- Teamlab is cool! 
- about Human-Centered Design Thinking
	- consist of 4 main components
		- Design of experience
			- I think this is relevant to UX and UI 
		- Active user participation
			- this is 1 of Agile Principles
			- Agile Principle 1: Active User Involvement Is Imperative
			- https://www.101ways.com/agile-principle-1-active-user-involvement-is-imperative/
		- Personalize experience
			- everyone are different
		- well execution
	- This concept might be useful for my senior project 
- Interactive experience development process
	- This seems to be based on waterfall model
	- Steps (simplified)
		- State the goal
		- Define the user group
		- Build simple stories in location that users can engage
			- is this likes prototyping?
		- develop the personal experience interactive 
		- describe user experience scenarios for develop navigation system
		- outline what users may want to access while using our interactive project 
		- consider methods that user may use to share their experience
		- provide opportunity for nerds

# 3. Encounter
> [!NOTE]
> My in-class + outside the class's interpretation about this lecture. 
> What I encounter during class in linear format?
- next week's assignment  
	- INVESTORY - explore online 
		- learn about museum design process
	- Bangkok Design Week
		- visit digital media or creative techs
		- learn about place making space
- Storywise - former ESIC students - bangkok design week 2024
- interesting term: cross media space
	- from slide: Cross Media Spaces Technology: Realization, Implementation and Construction
	- technology-realization (make it happen), implementation and construction
- designer is like a middle man between artist and engineer 
	-  we must design and explore about who will use our tech or who will be beneficial first
		- many newbie engineers usually don't have this mindset
- NOISE behind the scene
	- foam on speaker provide analogue feedback
	- interaction with object
	- that graph generated by
		- engineer plot the graph and from sound data
		- artists make it look chaotic for presentation
- for interactive things, if you can let audience engage with your friends or unknow ppl it would be good
- behavioral analysis is important, you need to understand ppl who will use your product (it involved in UX and UI design)
	- consider user persona
- producer to consumer, giver to taker 
	- for sensei, youtubers are consumer in some extents
- digital is a bigger set than computer and IT
- entertainment technology
	- is one part of digital arts
		- Digital art
			- Multidiscipline expertise and digital techs
			- picture from slide[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/d2872f91ca484ddbdbff46aef57fefd2.png)](https://gyazo.com/d2872f91ca484ddbdbff46aef57fefd2)
	- entertainment technology components
		- Technology
		- Business
		- Entertainment & Art & Creative
		- picture from slide[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/b291df145dcd9459a749448034ebadfd.png)](https://gyazo.com/b291df145dcd9459a749448034ebadfd)
	- entertainment technology - value chain
		- Sensei(s) will revisit this concept and pipeline
		- content acquisition >  operation > distribution > marketing n sale > delivery
		- picture from slide[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/41f3d39ee2e6675dace40d89ee331be0.png)](https://gyazo.com/41f3d39ee2e6675dace40d89ee331be0)
	- examples
		- national museum Zurich - Switzerland 
		- wonder through the crystal universe, team lab, Japan - very cool
			- [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tPKBDPWOtGk/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tPKBDPWOtGk)
		- Teamlab borderless teaser video - very cool
			-  [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LOMbrwzqW4A/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LOMbrwzqW4A)
			- Sensei: Teamlab is similar to ESIC lab 
- many Bangkok Design Week's show inspired from Teamlab

- why doing so and how
	- Empower audiences or visitor with Interactivity
	- Integrate computer + Digital Media Tech + Interactive OBJ --> Museum Exhibition
	- Must understand : Design Process, interactivity
	- Create Tangible and interaction
		- Tangible: a thing that is perceptible by touch
	- picture from slide[![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/9398ca23a67c92622149775e2d17382a.png)](https://gyazo.com/9398ca23a67c92622149775e2d17382a)
- Some more examples
	- museum at berlin
		- Digital media - 3d programming for guiding museum - 20 years ago 
		- Babylonian gate around German and turkey 
- fun fact: Design brief is the full word of brief 
- Design brief
	- How might we design xxx and dev xxx module in this physical space that
		- If ppl enter that room and u need them to understand the emotion from some scene or message that u want to tell
		- Interaction 
- Technology can be part of many things
	- I like this picture
